### A try to resurrect the ruby-lol gem! o/ 

I'm restoring this dead lol wrapper gem. 
I'm doing this in a separate project because I plan to make break changes to the source code.

When things get better all contributions will be welcome, take the time to organize the house. :)

My main mission is to make all gem modules work again, add new Riot API features, and bring the
existing code to fresh ruby syntax.
