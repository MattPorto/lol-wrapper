### A try to ressurect the ruby-lol gem! o/ 

I'm restoring this dead lol wrapper gem. 
I'm doing this in a separate project because I'm planning to do break changes on source code.

When things get better all contributions will be welcome, just take a time to I organize the house. :)

My main mission is make all gem modules working again, add new Riot API features and bring the
existing code to fresh ruby syntax.
